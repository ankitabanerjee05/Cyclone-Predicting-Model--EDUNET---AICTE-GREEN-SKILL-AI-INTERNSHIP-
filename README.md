🌪️ **Cyclone Predicting Model**
A simple machine learning model to predict the formation and intensity of tropical cyclones based on historical weather data.


🔍 **Overview**

- This project uses weather and cyclone data to train a model that can:
- Predict the chances of cyclone formation
- Estimate cyclone intensity (like wind speed or pressure)
- Optionally track its movement (if trajectory data is included)
- The goal is to support early warnings and disaster preparedness.


🛠️ **Tech Used**
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
